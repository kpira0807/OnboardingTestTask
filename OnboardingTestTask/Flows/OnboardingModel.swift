Solution ideas:
 1. Prioritize meetings that are most important and reschedule or cancel the rest
 2. Set a time limit for each meeting
 3. Try to combine meetings that have similar topics
 4. Request an agenda before each meeting to ensure it's necessary for you to attend
 5. Try to attend meetings virtually to save time on travel
 6. Delegate someone else to attend the meeting on your behalf if possible
 7. Schedule meetings for specific days and times to avoid interruptions throughout the day
 8. Use meeting time to brainstorm and problem-solve with colleagues to make the most of the time
 9. Use meeting time to build relationships with colleagues and network
 10. Consider alternative communication methods like email or instant messaging for non-urgent matters.
